    summary: |
      Playwright tests need to know the cookie value to use to tell Drupal to
      use a specific test prefix. It turns out this is a single global function
      function, so we haven't gone to the trouble of writing a full Drush
      command for it.

      This command will only ever output the direct cookie value unless there
      is an error. The cookie value will have colons replaced with %3A.
