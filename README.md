# Playwright in Drupal (in DDEV)

This project, building on [deviantintegral/ddev-playwright](https://github.com/deviantintegral/ddev-playwright), enables full support for Playwright testing of Drupal websites.

1. Supports fast parallel tests by installing sites into sqlite databases.
2. Enables Playwright tests to run Drush commands against a test site.

## Requirements

- The Drupal site must be using DDEV for development environments.
- The Drupal site is meant to be tested after a site install, like how Drupal core tests work.
- The Playwright tests must be using `npm` as their package manager.
  - PRs supporting yarn are welcome! It's unclear at this moment how we could integrate yarn packages into the separate directory Playwright requires for test libraries.
- Playwright tests will be written in TypeScript.

## Getting Started

Integrating this library into a site takes several steps. For the sake of completeness, these steps start as if you are starting a brand-new Drupal site.

### Create the Drupal Site and Initialize DDEV

```console
composer create-project drupal/recommended-project pwtest
composer require drush/drush
cd pwtest
ddev config --project-type drupal10
ddev get deviantintegral/ddev-playwright
ddev start
```

### Initialize Playwright Tests

```console
mkdir -p test/playwright
ddev exec -- npx create-playwright@latest --lang=TypeScript --quiet test/playwright --no-browsers
```

### Install Playwright Dependencies

This command will build a web image that contains the browsers we omitted above. Building this way allows for much faster startup times for environments that don't need Playwright, and also allows for caching of large downloads.

```console
ddev install-playwright
```

### Check Playwright Works

Before going further, make sure Playwright can run a sample test against https://playwright.dev.

```console
ddev exec -d /var/www/html/test/playwright npx playwright test
```

### Add the playwright-drupal Integration

```console
ddev exec -d /var/www/html/test/playwright npm i playwright-drupal
```
```console
# Or, to pull from GitHub's main branch:
ddev exec -d /var/www/html/test/playwright npm i playwright-drupal@github:deviantintegral/playwright-drupal
```

### Configure Playwright

Set the following in `test/playwright/tsconfig.json`, merging with any existing configuration:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noEmit": true,
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@playwright-drupal": ["./packages/playwright-drupal"]
    }
  },
  "include": [
    "tests/**/*.ts"
  ]
}
```

Add the following `globalSetup` and `use` line to the `defineConfig` section in `test/playwright/playwright.config.ts`:
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  globalSetup: require.resolve('./node_modules/playwright-drupal/lib/global-setup'),
  baseURL: process.env.DDEV_PRIMARY_URL,
  use: {
    ignoreHTTPSErrors: true,
  }
})
```

### Ignore playwright-drupal from Git

We have to copy the library outside the `node_modules` directory for Playwright to work correctly. Ignore this directory from git, since it's effectively a npm package:

```console
echo './packages/playwright-drupal' >> test/playwright/.gitignore
```

### Create Taskfile.yml

In the root of your project, create `Taskfile.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3'
silent: true
includes:
  playwright:
    taskfile: test/playwright/node_modules/playwright-drupal/tasks/playwright.yml
    optional: true
```

### Add Playwright to Drupal's Settings

Add the following line to `web/sites/default/settings.php`:

```php
include '../test/playwright/node_modules/playwright-drupal/settings/settings.playwright.php';
```

### Create and Run an Example Drupal Test

Copy the following to `test/playwright/tests/example.drupal.spec.ts`.

```typescript
import { test, expect, execDrushInTestSite } from '@playwright-drupal';

test('has title', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');

  // Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
});

// This tests proves parallel databases work by setting a random title for the
// first node created in the site.
test('proves parallel tests work', async ({ page }) => {
  await execDrushInTestSite('user:password admin "correct horse battery staple"');
  await page.goto('/user/login');
  const username = page.getByLabel('Username');
  const password = page.getByLabel('Password');
  const loginButton = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Log in' });
  await username.fill('admin');
  await password.fill('correct horse battery staple');
  await loginButton.click();

  await page.goto('/node/add/article');

  let randomTitle = (Math.random() + 1).toString(36).substring(2);
  await page.getByLabel('Title', { exact: true }).fill(randomTitle);
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Save' }).click();

  await expect(page.url()).toMatch('node/1')

  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(`${randomTitle} | Playwright`);
  await expect(page.locator('h1')).toHaveText(randomTitle);
});
```

Run the test with:

```console
ddev playwright test
# Or you can run inside the container with:
ddev ssh
cd test/playwright
npx playwright test
```

You should see output similar to this:

```console
$ ddev playwright test
Task playwright:install:hook does not exist. Running drush site:install --yes...
 You are about to:
 * CREATE the '/tmp/sqlite/.ht.sqlite' database.

 // Do you want to continue?: yes.

## Replacing the Standard Profile With Your Own

Out of the box, we can't know what setup steps your site needs to work correctly. To use your own steps, add a `playwright:install:hook` task to your Taskfile. This will be called with the right environment set so that the site is installed into sqlite (and not your normal ddev database). From here, run Drush commands or call other tasks as needed to install your site. To test this when developing, feel free to call `task playwright:install` without actually running tests.

## Running Drush in Tests

There's many good reasons to want to run Drush in a test. The above example sets a known password for an account so the test can log in. Other good reasons are to scaffold out test data, or turn on testing-related modules.

To run Drush during a test, use `execDrushInTestSite` as shown in the example test. This ensures that Drush bootstraps against the test site, and not the default site.

There may be times you want to run Drush once, globally before all tests. In that case, add a `playwright:install:hook` task to your Taskfile, and from there you can call Drush or anything else you may need to do during setup.

## Running Tests Without Isolation

There are times you may want to run Playwright without isolating test runs. Perhaps you're manually scaffolding test content by hand, before writing code to create it. Or perhaps you would like to be absolutely sure that a test passes or fails when running against mariadb.

To do this, run `export PLAYWRIGHT_NO_TEST_ISOLATION=1`. This **must** be done inside a ddev shell (via ddev ssh) and not `ddev playwright` or `ddev exec`. Consider running Playwright with `--workers=1` and with a single browser, since any changes to the database will persist.
